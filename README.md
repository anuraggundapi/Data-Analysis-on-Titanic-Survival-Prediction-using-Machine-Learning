# Data-Analysis-on-Titanic-Survival-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

➢ In this Project, we will gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger 
information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled train.csv 
and the other is titled test.csv. 

➢ Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and 
importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”. 

➢ The test.csv dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for 
each passenger. It’s our job to predict these outcomes. 

➢ Dataset Details:
891 rows and 11 columns
Passenger Class, 
Name, 
Sex, 
Age, 
Number of passenger's siblings and spouses on board(SibSp), 
Number of passenger’s parents and children on board(Parch), 
Ticket, 
Fare, 
Cabin, 
City where passenger embarked

➢ Project Overview:
The project presents a comprehensive data analysis of the Titanic dataset, aiming 
to uncover valuable insights and patterns related to the infamous RMS Titanic disaster. The 
dataset contains information about passengers, including their demographics, ticket class, cabin 
location, and survival status. Through a series of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis 
(EDA), and statistical modeling techniques, we delve into various aspects of the dataset.The 
report begins with data preprocessing, where missing values are handled, and features are 
engineered to enhance the dataset's usability. Following this, the EDA phase provides 
descriptive statistics, visualizations, and correlations to understand passenger demographics, 
survival rates, and factors that influenced survival.Furthermore, we employ statistical modeling 
techniques, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to predict 
passenger survival. These models are evaluated for their accuracy, and feature importance is 
analyzed to identify critical factors impacting survival probabilities.The findings of this 
analysis provide valuable insights into the Titanic disaster, shedding light on the demographics 
of passengers, their chances of survival based on various factors, and the predictive power of 
different machine learning models. This project contributes to a better understanding of the 
tragic event and demonstrates the power of data analysis in extracting meaningful information 
from historical datasets.
